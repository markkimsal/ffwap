Facebook Fish Wrangler Auto Player (FFWAP)
========================================================================

http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/60661


Runs fishwrangler while you have an open tab. You can turn on and off 
auto-fishing as well as auto-tournament fishing.

Features:
* Doesn't fish when you are out of chum.
* Doesn't fish when you have a treasure chest.
* Independently start/stop tournament and regular fishing.

It started with this one line script: 
http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/39300 Then that got me thinking 
about changing the timing of the fishing, and seeing if there was 
treasure on the screen. Nothing is more annoying than an auto-player 
script that wastes the server's resources. This script will not fish 
if you have treasure on the screen or if you are out of chum. This 
should reduce the load on the FW server.
